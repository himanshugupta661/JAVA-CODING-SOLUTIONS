# Java Exception Handling (Try-catch)

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values(Wikipedia). $\{1,2,3\}$ is an example of a set, but $\{1,2,2\}$ is not a set. Today you will learn how to use sets in java by solving this problem.<br>

You are given $n$ pairs of strings. Two pairs $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are identical if $a=c$ and $b=d$. That also implies $(a,b)$ is *not* same as $(b,a)$. After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem.


**Input Format**

In the first line, there will be an integer $T$ denoting number of pairs. Each of the next $T$ lines will contain two strings seperated by a single space.

**Constraints:**

* $1 \le T \le 100000$
* Length of each string is atmost $5$ and will consist lower case letters only.


**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

Print $T$ lines. In the $i_{th}$ line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking $i^{th}$ pair as input.

```java

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        try {
            int x = sc.nextInt();
            int y = sc.nextInt();

            System.out.println(x / y);
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.println("java.util.InputMismatchException");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero");
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}

```
